It's an idea I coded up a while back mostly for the heck of it, but it seemed like it would be neat to
throw it up on github and see if anyoe else thought it was a cool idea.
The idea is to have completely untraceable contact with some server and get it to run commands for you
possible extensions include sending small files via the base64 encoding scheme that has been chosen for
the bitmessage protocol, further obfuscation of client and server, chan hopping, and so much more.
